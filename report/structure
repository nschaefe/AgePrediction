Age prediction in pokec (TODO)

General Motivation:

-inference (which features reveal something about age)
-> to learn about correlations, connections, hints for causality, e.g. certain jobs are only done by old people 
(PROBLEM: Our feature set is weak to give big insights here)

-feature importance
-> feature extraction can be expensive, so on which features to focus on, reduce noise for better prediction

-prediction performance
-> if good, gives rise to privacy concerns

----------------------------------

Introduction:
Overview about what we want to do:
-use pokec
-select feautres
-correlations, correlation like measures
-feature relevance in models (PROBLEM: which strategy to find useless features)
-prediction, metrics

Prediction results:
-Different metrics and different models
-how to address the biased dataset (PROBLEM: undersampling of final dataset is not really complete, better remove already in the graph)
-prediction performance compared to related work

Remarks, Problems, Insights, Open questions:
-What title? 
-graph embedding is graph dependent (classifier not transferable) 

##What is the reason to state this. This is a known disadvantage of graph embeddings.
There is a privacy risk nonetheless. Consider a user that uses the  services of an OSN like FB and does not 
provide the age. If we show that graph embedding is the most powerful feature to predict age, then this becomes
a factor in user privacy risk. FB or any other company that it provides data to can determine the user age.

-Time is relative (we do everything relative to the time where data was gathered) 

##This is true but why state this? If we know the time data is collected, we can just add the time to now and get their age now

-Undersampling technique is not optimal
-How much data do we need?
## There could have been some nice experiments here. Like pruning the graph structure to calculate embeddings and 
then see how well they work. Perhaps not enough time to do this.

-We removed incomplete samples but kept graph embedding, why is this ok -> can be collected always, contains additional not biasing information?
